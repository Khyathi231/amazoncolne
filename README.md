# amazoncolne
This is my first project in web development.
<br>
An Amazon clone built with HTML and CSS replicates the layout and design of Amazon's website, featuring product cards, a navigation bar, and a footer. It focuses on front-end elements like responsive design using media queries. The project includes a basic homepage and product pages without server-side functionality. This clone helps develop front-end skills with HTML for structure and CSS for styling and responsiveness
